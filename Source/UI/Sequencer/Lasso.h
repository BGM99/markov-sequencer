    // Transaction identifier, and why is it needed:
    // some actions, like dragging notes around, are performed in a single undo transaction,
    // but, unlike mouse dragging (where it's clear when to start and when to end a transaction),
    // hotkey-handled actions will always do a checkpoint at every keypress, so that
    // pressing `cursor down` 5 times and `cursor up` 3 times will result in 8 undo actions,
    // (there only should be 2, for transposing events down and up accordingly).
    // So, Lasso class re-generates its random id every time it changes,
    // and some transform operations here will use that id, combined with operation id
    // to identify the transaction and see if the last one was exactly of the same type and target,
    // and checkpoint could be skipped.
